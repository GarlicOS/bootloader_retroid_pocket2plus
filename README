This is a sample implementation of a MicroSD card compatible bootloader
for Retroid's Retroid Pocket 2+ T310-based gaming handheld.

It works by hijacking the device's recovery mode and re-routing the
boot flow into a 1st stage init script located in an exfat-formatted
MicroSD card's boot folder.

Ideally, one should use said 1st stage init script to bootstrap a
rootfs and execute a 2nd stage init script within said rootfs.

To build the bootloader simply execute the build.sh script.
You'll find the bootloader files in a newly created folder named sdboot.

Flash the created files into both boot slots of
your device to enable booting from MicroSD cards.

To boot from MicroSD card...

1) Hold down the Power and Volume Up buttons (at the same time)
2) Let go of both buttons once you see the boot logo 
(the device should not vibrate if done correctly)
